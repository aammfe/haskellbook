-- Functor is all about a pattern of mapping over structure.

-- Functors are combinators:
   -- they take a sentence or phrase as input and produce a sentence or phrase as an output, with
   -- some logical operation applied to the whole.

-- A functor is a way to apply a function over or around some structure that we don’t want to alter.
   -- That is, we want to apply the function to the value that is “inside” some structure and leave
   -- the structure alone.
